				<h2>Overview:</h2>
				<p>Single-page applications are dynamic websites (as opposed to a single static HTML page) which deliver the content with a
					single major page load (HTML, core CSS, etc.), using AJAX or similar requests for delivering further content.</p>
				<p>The use of AJAX allows the remaining pages to load quickly in the background, presenting a near-instantaneous change to
					the user, rather than a disruptive page load. This effect is often called "responsive," although I prefer the term the Meteor
					community has introduced, "reactive," which avoids confusion with responsive web design.</p>
				<p>Web sockets, part of the HTML5 recommendation, are an alternative to using AJAX, but AJAX remains far more popular currently,
					due to its integration into popular JavaScript frameworks such as jQuery, Angular, Backbone and many others, as well as frameworks
					in other languages, such as Ruby and PHP.</p>

							<h2>Going Deeper</h2>
							<h3>Code reuse</h3>
							<p>An SPA should minimize unique code and data and reuse as much of it as possible. A request to the server for another page
								of information, will not retrieve another complete HTML page from DOCTYPE to closing BODY tag. Rather, just those elements
								of the DOM that are changing in the new view will be reloaded.</p>
							<p>In many cases, pages will have a similar HTML structure and a page request only switches out data within DOM elements, often
								through JSON or XML. Modern JavaScript libraries often include a template-making solution to convey data from the model to
								the view, such as Express, Handlebars/Mustache, Angular directives, and many others.</p>
							<p>At any rate, only those items which needed to be loaded should be. This allows the entirety of the site to be viewable while
								minimizing load times and server activity.</p>
						</section>

							<h2>Structure and Design Pattern</h2>
							<p>SPAs can be either MVC (Model-View-Controller) or MVVM(Model-View - ViewModel). AngularJS, for instance, uses an MVVM model,
								with the HTML/CSS, and Angular directives functioning as the view, business logic handled by JavaScript objects as the model,
								and the rest of the code ($scope, controllers, and other functions) as the ViewModel.</p>
							<h3>States</h3>
							<p>From Google:</p>
							<blockquote>
								<p>While traditional static web sites consist of many pages, a more appropriate term for AJAX applications is "state". An application
									consists of a number of states, where each state constitutes a specific user experience or a response to user input. Examples
									of states: For a mail application, states could be base state, inbox, compose, etc. For a chess application, states could
									be base state, start new game, but also current state x of the chessboard, including information about past moves, whose
									player's turn it is, and so forth</p>
							</blockquote>
							<p>Essentially, the "partial" bits of served on static sites were various pages, now there is, as far as the client is concerned,
								a "page" which changes "states," for instance, switching between a "home page" state and a "search results" state, although
								informally these are often called pages.</p>

							<h2>Challenges</h2>
							<h3>SEO</h3>
							<p>SEO can be a major concern for JavaScript-based SPA websites, as search engine crawlers do not interact with Javascript.</p>
							<p>One way of compensating for this is to detect crawlers, and pre-render the site and serve it to the crawler as a static
								HTML page. FRC Mobile currently does this with Prerender.io.</p>
							<p>Prerender uses so-called "middleware" to check if client requests are coming from a crawler or not. If so, the middleware
								forwards the request to prerender.io which sends a pre-rendered static page to the server, which then sends it to the crawler.
								Since the response comes from the server, the crawler sees this as a normal server response to its request, and is unaware
								of the hand-off and return from prerender.io.</p>
						</section>

						<h2>Challenges, cont.</h2>
						<h3>Analytics</h3>
						<p>Analytics is another difficulty that arises, since traditional pages do not load. However, many analytics services have
							created versions of their services to work in particular SPA frameworks. Some of those available for Angular include angular-google-
							analytics and Angulartics, which can work with Site Catalyst. DTM has taken SPAs into account as well.</p>
						<h3>Initial Page Load</h3>
						<p>Because so many of the framework's modules need to be available on the initial page load in an SPA, optimizing page load
							is essential. Lazy-loading is an important part of reducing the initial rendering of the view, as is caching components.</p>
